# coffee-simulations
The primary aim of my research is to evaluate the suitability of pore-scale physics for the simulation of coffee extraction. Simulations have previously been carried out using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, in-silico and to name a few, but not without their own assumptions and drawbacks. While pore-scale physics have been employed for general studies of multi-phase flow through a porous medium, it has not yet been extended to coffee extraction. 

However, just like other simulation methods used to study coffee extraction, assumptions will also need to be made for pore-scale physics to be a suitable simulation framework. The most important assumption is that the control volume of interest will be taken to be small enough that coffee grounds are assumed to be immobile compared to the fluid flow around them.  

Additionally, should pore-scale physics be found to be a suitable simulation framework, a secondary aim is to use this pore-scale physics simulations to evaluate the effect of 7 variables listed below and their effect on coffee extraction.

The parameters I would like to study are:

    Brew ratio

    Pour rate

    Pour height

    Water temperature

    Grind size

    Grind size distribution (to a small extent)

    Packing method
